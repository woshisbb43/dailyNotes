## angular component communication via shared service.
Angular components can easily communicate each other via shared service. Unlike @input and @output, shared service enable communication via any components. 

## learned lesson
Do not **provide** additional **sharedService** for single component when the global **sharedService** is injected. Because this will initiate several independent **sharedService** (depends on how many compoennts participate). And independent **sharedService** can not communicate with each other (as far as I know).
