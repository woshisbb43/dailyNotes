# Thinking in Layers and aspects

## sperating to application layer(user's needs) & implementation layer(tech detail)

## functional(verb) vs non-functional(adj)

# seeing the big picture

## two types of software architecture
centralized & distributed.

# Discovering the core problem
maintaining integrity in distributed systems is the major purpose of the blockchain. 

## trust and integrity in peer-to-peer systems

1. **integrity**  :system to be safe, complete, consistent, correct, and free of corruption and errors.
